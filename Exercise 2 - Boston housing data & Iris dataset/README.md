# Exercise 2 - Boston housing data and Iris dataset

The Iris dataset can be found on the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris'>UCI Machine Learning Repository<a/>.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

* Id
* SepalLengthCm
* SepalWidthCm
* PetalLengthCm
* PetalWidthCm
* Species

The Boston housing data can be found <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/'>here<a/>.
