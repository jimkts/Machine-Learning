# Exercise 1 - Wine Quality dataset
Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced.

The data were taken from the UCI <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality'>Machine Learning Repository<a/>.
